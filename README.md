# Warframe Relic Helper

## Overview
Warframe Relic Helper(WRH) is a web application designed to help Warframe players maximize their potential profit by identifying the most valuable relics to run based on current fissure availability and preferred mission types. It simplifies the decision-making process by analyzing market data, drop chances, and player preferences to recommend the best relics for maximizing platinum earnings.

Choosing a relic was too overwhelming when there were so many choices. I created this out of a need to not think and just figure out which I should choose. I also needed to have a quick reference of prices and volume.

Alecaframe does a MUCH better job. Use that for sure. This is just a quick reference or if you don't have or want to use Overwolf.
WRH also helps you choose based on what types of mission you like. For example, I can't stand spy missions and prefer endless missions so its an easy way to see whats available.

## Features
- **Fissure Mission Filtering**: Users can filter available fissure missions based on mission type, including both normal and endless missions.
- **Customizable Search**: Offers options for Steel Path missions, refinement levels (Intact, Exceptional, Flawless, Radiant), and types of relics (Lith, Meso, Neo, Axi, Requiem).
- **Dynamic Sorting by TEV**: Relics are sorted by their Total Expected Value (TEV), calculated using drop chances, market prices, and trading volumes.
- **Real-time Market Data**: Integrates with live market data to provide up-to-date pricing and volume information for more accurate recommendations.

### Accessing the App
